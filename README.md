# Dataset for CH Equation with Data-assimilation Method
This dataset concludes the initial conditions used in the article " An efficient data assimilation based unconditionally stable scheme for Cahn-Hilliard equation". The data will be classified according to the experiments.

# Note!
1. Please note that in some experiments, we used the random values as the initial conditions, which are generated by the random function in Matlab. Thus, we will not upload this kind of data.  
2. In some experiments, we also upload the data generated file instead of the data file.
